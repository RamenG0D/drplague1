- Hi, Iâ€™m RamenG0D
- im interested I low low level programming not hardware but low enough that you have to create things yourself and understand your code well
- I'm currently work on creating a lexer and parser from scratch in c (not on github yet)

I'm almost always working on a project, I think the next one might be to learn how to implement true 3D graphics myself, but I might just choose to do something else.
