- Hi, Iâ€™m RamenG0D
- im recently addicted to rust
- i enjoy low level programming
- I'm almost always working on a new project.

Ever since i started using C for many of my projects i loved how simplistic the syntax is but always disliked bugs caused by bad programming. So i started using rust, but i disliked the general syntax so my next project is to smash the syntax of C into Rusts saftey and features (with a transpiler).
